## Schematic Sheets

| Sheet | Description |
|---|---|
| `/` | One-sheet SUBOLI carrier/motherboard schematic: power/protection, off-board MA12070 module power/signal interfaces, OPA1622 headphone stage, panel header interfaces, interior glow, star-ground net tie, and notes. |

MA12070 module is off-board, stacked on standoffs; speaker outputs wire module→Speakon directly; J5/J6 are the only board↔module interfaces. Deferred-footprint list is now EMPTY.

Verbatim ERC report excerpt:

```text
ERC report (2026-06-11T23:47:39, Encoding UTF8)
Report includes: Errors, Warnings, Exclusions

***** Sheet /

 ** ERC messages: 0  Errors 0  Warnings 0

 ** Ignored checks:
    - Global label only appears once in the schematic
    - Four connection points are joined together
    - Assigned footprint doesn't match footprint filters
```

## Deviations / Incomplete Items

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| PCB layout | Not present. `kicad/suboli_control.kicad_pcb` is a schematic-phase placeholder with 0 footprints, 0 pads, 0 tracks, 0 vias, and 0 copper zones. |
| DRC report | Skipped because no PCB layout exists. |
| 3D render | Skipped because no PCB layout exists. |
| Footprints | Assigned for all BOM references. Deferred-footprint list is EMPTY. |
| Stock footprint validation | All assigned stock footprint names were found in installed KiCad libraries after the R3.1 footprint-name corrections. |
| MA12070 module | Off-board, stacked on standoffs; speaker outputs wire module→Speakon directly; J5/J6 are the only board↔module interfaces. |
| TVS1 | Value updated to `P6KE24A`; Supplier_PN remains pending. |
| Interior glow | Added. glow circuit is power-rail driven, switched by SW1. |
| Generator script | ARCHIVED — stale since commit 166da31. The .kicad_sch is the sole source of truth. |
| GitHub upload | Uploaded by Git over SSH after the repository was created externally. |

## Checkpoints

| Checkpoint | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1. MA12070 module moved off-board | DONE | `A1`, `J3`, and `OUTL+`/`OUTL−`/`OUTR+`/`OUTR−` are removed; `J5` feeds `+19V`/`GND_STAR` and `J6` feeds `TACT_INL`/`GND_SIG`/`TACT_INR`. |
| 2. PWR_FLAG symbols present on power nets | DONE | `#FLG1` `+19V_RAW`, `#FLG2` `+19V`, `#FLG3` `GND_STAR`, `#FLG4` `+19V_HP`, `#FLG5` `GND_SIG`, `#FLG6` `VGND`. |
| 3. ERC warnings reported, not suppressed | DONE | ERC was exported with `--severity-all`; report shows `0 Errors 0 Warnings` and includes exclusions. |
| 4. OPA1622 stage component values match confirmed design | DONE | Actual values: `R4`/`R5` = 10 k left gain network; `R6`/`R7` = 10 k right gain network; `R2`/`R3` = 100k input bias to `VGND`; `U1` = TLE2426ILP, no resistor divider; `C5`/`C7` decouple `+19V_HP` to `GND_STAR`; `C6`/`C8` decouple `VGND` to `GND_SIG`; A2 output coupling `C11`/`C12` = 470uF/25V; output series `R8`/`R9` = 10 ohm. |
| 5. Footprint assignments verified against installed libraries | DONE | All assigned stock footprints were found in the installed KiCad libraries; the custom F1 footprint remains in the project-local `suboli_control` library. |
| 6. Supplier fields exported in BOM | DONE | `reports/bom.csv` includes `Supplier` and `Supplier_PN` columns; J5/J6 carry the requested HESTORE order codes. |
| 7. Generator script archived | DONE | `kicad/tools/generate_suboli_schematic_ARCHIVED.py` carries the archive header and the old generator path was removed. |
